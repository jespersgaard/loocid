# Loocid v1.0
# Scrum & Kanban tracking board.

This is an attempt for me to pickup PHP again. It is only a pet project, and probably will never even be close to functional.
The goal of this project is to implement a well-designed board to be used for distributed teams performing either Kanban or Scrum.

Reporting, User Management, and Ease-Of-Use are values that are important while developing on this project.
